      "question": "How does the game work?",
      "answer":
        "DinnerSpinner is a real-time social wheel game powered by PUBG items. It works just like the classic money wheel games that can be found on the gaming floors of land based casinos, which are hugely popular given that they are based entirely on luck and require no special skills or strategy to play. All you need to do is place a bet on where you think the wheel will spin to a stop and wait for the spin. If the wheel stops on your chosen number, you become an instant winner."
    },
    "1": {
      "category": "game",
      "question": "How do I play?",
      "answer":
        "The Wheel is separated into 54 colourful segments numbered 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40. Once you have funded your on site balance, all you need to do is click the betting chip with the amount you're comfortable betting with, and then choose the number you wish to bet on. If any bets are found in the game, the countdown is started. When it reaches zero, the wheel will spin and stop on a field, determining whether you are a winner. If you’re lucky enough to win, your winning money will automatically be credited to your account. After each spin, you will have the option to bet again, or leave the game. If you’re feeling sociable, you can chat with other like-minded players on the right-hand side of the screen."

    "2": {
      "category": "game",
      "question": "How much can I win?",
      "answer":
        "Our game has a theoretical RTP (return to player) of 95.58%, with minimum bets starting at just {{minBet}}, making it suitable for recreational punters and high rollers. The amount you can win on the money wheel depends on the size of your bet and the number you have bet on. Each number appears on the wheel a different number of times, with the less frequently occurring numbers resulting in the highest payouts. Your winnings are calculated like so: your bet * the field + your bet. Its simple!"
    },
    "3": {
      "category": "game",
      "question": "What are those multipliers?",
      "answer":
        "When the wheel rolls 2x or 7x, your bets are multiplied by that field and the wheel is spun again. These can stack on top of eachother leading to masive jackpot rounds!"
